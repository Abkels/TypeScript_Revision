Typescript helps to reduce errors and bugs in your code before it is ready for deployment

install typescript, npm i -g typescript
check the version, tsc --version
tsc --init (creates a tsconfig.json file)
tsc filename.ts(to compile your typescript file to javascript. it creayes a javascript file as well)
node filename.js (to run on the console)


To ensure that the files are being compiled automatically when saved run 
"tsc filename.ts --watch"  // this watches for any changes
